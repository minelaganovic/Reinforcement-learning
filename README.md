# Intelligent School Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning üè´üìö

This project demonstrates how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be applied to generate an optimized school schedule. The RL model assigns classes to teachers, rooms, and time slots based on constraints such as teacher and room availability.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Q-Learning algorithm is implemented for optimal scheduling.
- **Randomized Constraints:** Availability for teachers and rooms is generated dynamically for realistic scenarios.
- **Visualization:** The schedule is visualized in an intuitive, color-coded timetable format.
- **Dynamic Exploration:** Hyperparameters for learning can be tuned to observe different training behaviors.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
1. **Environment Setup:**  
   - Teachers, classrooms, and time slots are defined as environment parameters.
   - Availability of teachers and rooms is randomly assigned.

2. **Reward Function:**  
   The algorithm rewards valid assignments (teacher and room availability) and penalizes invalid ones.

3. **Reinforcement Learning:**  
   The Q-Learning algorithm trains over multiple episodes, exploring and exploiting actions to find the optimal schedule.

4. **Visualization:**  
   A final timetable is visualized using Matplotlib, showing class allocations for each day.
